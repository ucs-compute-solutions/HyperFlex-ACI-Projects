This repo contains ACI Terraform code for HyperFlex with ACI projects. The validated Terraform code associated with each project or solution is in a separate directory with a README file and a link to the CVD or whitepaper associated with the effort. 

Each solution directory may also have a sub-directory for optional Terraform code that was also validated using the same component (Terraform, Provider, ACI, HyperFlex) versions as the main code associated with the effort.
